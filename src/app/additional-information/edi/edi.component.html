  I am a firm believer in inclusivity and equal opportunities. I have volunteered my time in
  the past on numerous occasions to increase the access of marginalised groups to
  mathematical education. My most recent experience is tutoring refugees and asylum
  seekers to increase their chances of accessing college level education and improve their
  employability prospects.
