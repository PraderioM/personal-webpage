    Besides the ones obtained by the above mentioned courses I have extensive coding skills that I have obtained through
    self study. These skill include experience programming with <b>Python</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Java</b>,
    <b>Angular</b> and <b>GAP</b>. I have used these skills in the past to: create a computer simulation currently used for teaching
    purposes in physics classes in the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, develop image and language processing neural
    networks, develop multiple webpages (including the current one) for personal or common use, automate a variety of
    tedious tasks such as for example group assignment in workshops and many others. You can see some of my projects
    in my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/PraderioM" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page.
